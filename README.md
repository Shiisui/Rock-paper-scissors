## Feature

Move your cursor around the button START, and the rock, paper and scissors the background should change color.

## How to play

Press start, and choose between rock, paper and scissors (hopefully they are distinguishable).

A game lasts 4 rounds, after that you can play another game by pressing start.

## Known issues

Rock, paper and scissors images aren't really beautiful.

Moving the cursor outside the bounds of the buttons and images will not change the background color.

## Information

This project was made in two parts, first I had to make the game work in the console and then create a User Interface.

It's my first project with JavaScript so do not expect to see Clean Code.

I used HTML & CSS and JavaScript for this project.
